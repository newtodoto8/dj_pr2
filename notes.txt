A *a;
a->show();
just declares a pointer of type A*. Pointer alone is nothing but a variable that holds an address of some memory in it, i.e. it just points somewhere, nothing else. Pointer of type A* means that it points to memory, where an instance of type A is expected to be found.

a->show(); then just relies on this "expectation", but in fact it just uses uninitialized pointer, which results in undefined behavior.
