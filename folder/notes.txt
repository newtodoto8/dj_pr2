Read the documentation. This is by far the most underrated thing that could blow up your knowledge about a language. I can't count how many people ask me about problems that are well documented.
Learn the most popular libraries, why they were made, how they work. (I.e: Flask, Django, requests)
Try writing concurrent code, learn about threads, process, how they work, their weakness in Python.
Learn about sockets, network libraries, async features.
Learn a little about scipy and numpy.
Learn about interpreters, how they work, why there are so many different implementations of Python. (Python is written in English not C as many state, the most common implementation is a C based interpreter). This is a very important concept.
Learn about Python ecosystem. Please do not be a hipster writing code in the notepad, at least not yet. Learn to use PyCharm. Learn about PEP8. Learn about PIP, setuptools, virtualenv.
Learn about Python production brothers. Docker containers. UWSGI. Gunicorn. NGINX. All the stuff.
Learn tips and tricks from Google. Lambda functions. Decorators, descriptors, iterators, generators, metaclasses (Thanks Adrian Carpenter!). One liners like: "python -m http.server".
Write a lot of buggy code.
